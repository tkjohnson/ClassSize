<p>New York City officials are currently considering whether or not to amend class sizes in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in local schools. If passed, this bill would require classrooms to provide 35 square feet of room per student by 2023.</p>

<p>Leonie Haimson, founder of Class Size Matters testified before city council in support of this new legislation. According to their website, Class Size Matters is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to advocating for smaller classes.</p>

<p> "Students who are in smaller classes do better in every way that can be measured," Haimson said as she testified before officials. "They get better grades, higher test scores, are more likely to graduate from high school, go onto college and graduate with a STEM degree." </p>

<p>Data provided by the Department of Education shows Staten Island has the highest average class size in middle and high schools compared to the other boroughs, with 23.4 students per classroom.</p>
